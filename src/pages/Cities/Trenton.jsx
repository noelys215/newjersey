						"     Trenton, the capital city of New Jersey, is an industrial hub rich in history. Located at the head of navigation on the Delaware River, Trenton lies strategically between Philadelphia and New York City. Founded in 1679 by Quakers, it was later named after Philadelphia merchant William Trent in 1719. The city has played a crucial role in American history, notably during the Revolutionary War when General George Washington's army famously crossed the Delaware River. Trenton became New Jersey's capital in 1790, flourishing as an industrial center and transportation hub."
