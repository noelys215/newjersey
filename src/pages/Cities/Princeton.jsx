						"     Princeton's history is steeped in academic and revolutionary significance. The area, initially settled by Quakers in 1696, was originally known as Stony Brook. It was later renamed to honor William III of England. The city's cultural landscape was profoundly shaped by the relocation of the College of New Jersey, now Princeton University, in 1756 from Newark. The presence of this prestigious Ivy League institution, along with other educational entities like the Institute for Advanced Study, has fostered a vibrant intellectual environment. Princeton's historical relevance is also marked by events like the Battle of Princeton during the American Revolution, which saw a crucial victory by General George Washington's troops."
