						"     Atlantic City's history is a tapestry of innovation and entertainment. The area was originally inhabited by the Delaware Indians before European settlers arrived in the late 17th century. The city began to develop as a health resort in the 1800s and rapidly grew following the construction of the railroad, making it accessible from major urban centers. The famous Atlantic City Boardwalk, built in 1870, became a symbol of the city's leisure and entertainment culture, featuring amusement piers, rolling chairs, and the introduction of saltwater taffy. Over the years, Atlantic City has been home to the Miss America Pageant and has inspired the U.S. version of the board game Monopoly. The legalization of casino gambling in 1976 transformed the city into a major gambling and resort destination, further cementing its status as a key cultural and economic center in New Jersey."
